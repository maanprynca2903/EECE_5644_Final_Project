This project aims to organize and classify customer inquiries received by the financial institution JP Morgan Chase & Co. The objective is to identify complaints into five distinct service categories: Credit/Prepaid Card, Bank Account Services, Theft/Dispute Services, Mortgages/Loans, and Others. The dataset comprises variables of complaint ID, submission method, product, and sub-product, with customer-specific details anonymized to ensure privacy.
The project employs unsupervised learning techniques such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) in conjunction with clustering techniques for topic modeling and supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest for complaint classification. This is followed after the preprocessing phase of data cleaning, text lemmatization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA visualizes the length of the complaints and identifies common words and phrases for a better understanding of customer issues, which would enable better categorization.
The final goal of this project is to classify new queries with the most accurate algorithm found by comparing supervised learning models. Hence, the study intends to improve the performance of customer service and contribute to enhancing business performance by optimizing the query handling and resolution approach.
